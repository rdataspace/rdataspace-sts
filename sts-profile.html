			<!-- 1. Launch -->

			<div class="main-pane pt0 bdr">
				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>1. Launch</h2>
				</div>
				<p>The space shuttle is launched in a vertical position, with thrust provided by two solid rocket boosters, called the first stage, and three space shuttle main engines in the orbiter, called the second stage. The shuttle main engines are supplied with fuel from the External Tank. At lift off, both the boosters and main engines are operating.</p>
				<figure class="fl mr">
					<img class="shadow-gold" src="images/flight-profile-discovery.jpg" alt="Shuttle Launch and SRB Separation">
					<figcaption>
						Shuttle Discovery<br>
						Launch (left) and SRB Separation (right)
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>To achieve orbit, the shuttle must accelerate from zero to a speed of almost 28,968 kph, a speed nine times as fast as the average rifle bullet.</p>
				<p>To travel that fast, it must reach an altitude above most of Earth's atmosphere so that friction with the air will not slow it down or over heat it.</p>
				<p>The journey starts relatively slowly:<br>
				 at lift off, the shuttle weighs more than 2.04 million kilograms and it takes eight seconds for the engines and boosters to accelerate it to 161 kph.</p>
				 <p>After the first minute the shuttle is travelling more than 1,609 kph.</p>
			
				<!-- 2. First Stage Ascent -->

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>2. First Stage Ascent</h2>
				</div>
				<p>Two minutes into the flight the shuttle is about 45 km high and travelling more than 4,828 kph. The propellant in the two boosters is now exhausted and the booster casings are jettisoned to parachute into the Atlantic Ocean and be recovered by ships for re-use.</p>

				<!-- 3. Second Stage Ascent -->

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>3. Second Stage Ascent</h2>
				</div>
				<p>The three space shuttle main engines, attached to the rear of the shuttle orbiter, continue to fire until about 8.5 minutes after lift off, burning a half-million gallons of liquid propellant from the external fuel tank as the shuttle accelerates. The engines' exhaust is primarily water vapour and generate over 37 million horsepower as they push the shuttle toward orbit.</p>
				<p>Eight and a half minutes after launch, with the shuttle travelling 29,000 kph, the engines shut down as they use the last of their fuel. A few seconds after the engines stop, the external fuel tank is jettisoned from the shuttle. This tank is the only part of the shuttle that is not reused and burns up as it re-enters the atmosphere.</p>

				<!-- 4. Orbit -->

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>4. Orbit</h2>
				</div>
				<p>After the main engines shut down, the shuttle is in an elliptical orbit that, if nothing changed, would cause it to re-enter the atmosphere like the External Tank. When the shuttle has reached the highest point of the orbit, 35 minutes after the main engines have shut down, the two orbital manoeuvring system engines are fired for three minutes.</p>
				<img class="fl mr mb" src="sts-images/shuttle-discovery-harmony.jpg" alt="Shuttle Discovery Orbit">
				<p>This circularizes the shuttle's orbit at a safe altitude to keep it above the atmosphere. The orbital manoeuvring system engines are located on the left and right side of the shuttle's tail. They use two propellants that automatically burn whenever they contact one another.</p>
				<p>The shuttle is the only spacecraft ever built that can retrieve large satellites from orbit and bring them back to Earth. Using the Canadian-built robotic arm, called the Remote Manipulator System, shuttle crews can move large objects into or out of the payload bay.</p>
				<p>This arm, mounted on the left-hand edge of the payload bay, can also manoeuvre space walking astronauts into positions for satellite and space station repairs and maintenance.</p>
			</div>
			
			<!-- 5. De-Orbit -->

			<div class="main-pane pt0">
				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>5. De-Orbit</h2>
				</div>
				<p>To return to Earth, the shuttle is rotated tail first into the direction of travel to prepare for the de-orbit burn of the orbital manoeuvring system engines. This engine firing, usually about three minutes long, slows the shuttle by only about 300kph, but it is enough that it begins to descend toward the atmosphere.</p>
				<p>The engine firing takes place usually half a world away from the intended landing site. The rest of the slowing down for descent uses only the drag produced by the atmosphere. The aft steering jets are used to control the shuttle's orientation as it descends into the atmosphere.</p> 
				<p><img class="fr ml mb" src="sts-images/shuttle-discovery-gliding.jpg" alt="Shuttle Discovery Gliding">Around 25 minutes after the de-orbit burn the shuttle descends to a point where it first encounters the effects of the atmosphere, usually at an altitude of about 129 km and a range of more than 8,047 km from the landing site.</p>
				<p>Before the shuttle encounters the atmosphere, leftover fuel is burned from the forward reaction control system steering jets as a safety precaution.</p>
				<p>Before the shuttle reaches the upper atmosphere it is oriented with the nose angled up about 40 degrees from horizontal and its wings level. This orientation keeps the thermal tiles on the underside facing the majority of the heat generated by its encounter with the atmosphere. The heat can range as high as 1,648.9 degrees Celsius on the leading edges of the wings and nose.</p>

				<!-- 6. Landing -->

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>6. Landing</h2>
				</div>
				<img class="fr ml mt" src="sts-images/shuttle-discovery-landing.jpg" alt="Shuttle Discovery Landing">
				<p>As the shuttle descends into the atmosphere it begins a transition from spacecraft to aircraft. Its aero-surfaces, the wing flaps and rudder, gradually become active as air pressure builds and the steering jets turn off automatically.</p>
				<p>The shuttle then performs a series of four steep banks, rolling over as much as 80 degrees to one side or the other, to slow down. The series of banks gives the shuttle's ground track toward landing an appearance similar to a highly elongated letter "S".</p>
				<p>Approach to the landing site uses the following aids to navigation:</p>
				<p>* A radio beacon from the Tactical Air Navigation System, or TACAN, provides updated bearing information to the shuttle to aid in steering toward the runway.</p>
				<p>* Two air data probes are deployed from either side of the nose of the shuttle as it continues toward landing and its speed drops to less than three times the speed of sound, or Mach 3. These probes provide supplemental information on the airspeed and altitude derived from the outside barometric pressure and wind speed.</p>
				<p>* The shuttle's flight control computers are in control of the spacecraft until it is about 40 km from touchdown.</p>
				<p>* The commander takes over manual control when the shuttle's speed drops below the speed of sound and is at an altitude of 15,240 meters (50,000 feet).</p>
				<p>* The Microwave Scanning Beam Landing system which is installed at shuttle landing sites is used as an approach aid.</p>
				<p>* The commander normally flies the shuttle around an imaginary cylinder to align with the runway.</p>
				<p>* The shuttle then begins a steep descent with the nose angled as much as 19 degrees down from horizontal, a glide slope that is seven times as steep as the average commercial airliner landing. During the final approach, the shuttle drops toward the runway 20 times faster than a commercial airliner as its rate of descent and airspeed increase.</p>
				<p>* The commander pulls up the nose and slows the rate of descent when the shuttle is less than 610 meters (2,000 feet) above the ground. At this point, the pilot deploys the landing gear and the shuttle touches down.</p>
				<p>* After touchdown, the pilot deploys a drag chute from a compartment located just below the tail and the commander begins to drop the shuttle's nose gear slowly toward the runway. The drag chute is then jettisoned before the wheels come to a stop to ensure that it falls clear of the shuttle.</p>
