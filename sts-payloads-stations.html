The first main component of this 'space station' was launched into orbit in November 1998 and the first crew took up residence in October 2000. The station has been occupied continuously since then.</p>
				<p>The ISS is primarily a science research station, studying processes in micro gravity, long term exposure of materials in space and the effects on people living in near zero gravity. It is also inspiring innovations in technology, engineering and spacecraft design.</p>

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>ExPRESS Logistics Carriers 1 to 4 (ELC-1 and 2, 3, 4)</h2>
				</div>
				<p>A platform designed to support external pay loads mounted on the station with either deep space or Earth ward views. Each pallet spans the entire width of the shuttle's pay load bay, carries science experiments, and serves as a parking place for spare hardware that can be replaced robotically once on-orbit. All ELCs were mounted on the Integrated Truss Structure [ITS]. ELC-1 and 2 were delivered in one mission, with pay loads attached. ELC-3 and 4 were delivered on separate missions.</p>

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>Cupola Observational Module</h2>
				</div>
				<p>A small dome shaped module with seven windows, six on the sloping sides and one for direct viewing window. All windows have shutters to protect them from contamination and collisions with orbital debris or micrometeorites. The Cupola was berthed to the nadir (bottom) port of Node 3 (Tranquility). It therefore provides spectacular views of Earth and celestial objects as well as operations outside the ISS such as robotic activities, the approach of vehicles, and extra vehicular activity (EVA). It also has a workstation to control the station's robot arm.</p>

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>Mini-Research Module 1. [MRM-1] (Rassvet)</h2>
				</div>
				<p>A small cylindrical pressurised module docked to the nadir (bottom) port of the Russian Functional Cargo Block [FGB] (Zarya). It is primarily used for cargo storage and as a mini-research laboratory. It also provides a fourth docking port on the Russian Segment for spacecraft and a spare elbow joint for the European Robotic Arm (ERA).</p>

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>Permanent Multi Purpose Module (PMM)</h2>
				</div>
				<p>The Italian built Multi-purpose Logistics Module [MPLM], called Leonardo, made eight trips to the station. It was delivered to the station and returned to Earth by the shuttle. On its eighth trip to the station a modified Leonardo was temporarily berthed to the nadir (bottom) port of Node 1 (Unity) and then permanently berthed to the forward facing side port of Node 3 (Tranquility). Leonardo is now called the Permanent Multi Purpose Module [PMM]. It is used as a laboratory and for storage.</p>

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer 2 (AMS-2)</h2>
				</div>
				<p>A state-of-the-art particle physics detector. Using a large magnet to create a magnetic field that will bend the path of the charged cosmic particles, eight different instruments will provide information on those particles. This information will assist scientists to determine what the universe is made of and how it began. It was mounted on the station ITS S3 truss.</p>
