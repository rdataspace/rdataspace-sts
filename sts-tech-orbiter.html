					<p>The Orbiter Vehicle (OV) is the main component of the U.S. Space Shuttle (Space Transport System). It is launched like a rocket, can manoeuvre in Earth orbit like a spacecraft and lands like an aeroplane.</p>
					<p>The Shuttle is launched vertically, like a conventional rocket, with the two Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) operating in parallel with the Orbiters three main engines (SSMEs).<br>
					<p>These are fuelled from the the External Tank (ET) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The SRBs are jettisoned before the vehicle reaches orbit, and the ET is jettisoned just before orbit insertion.</p>

					<p class="padt" style="line-height: 1.5;">The orbiter fuselarge consists of three main sections:<br>
					<span class="color">Forward</span> (nose section) - Pressurized crew module and cockpit.<br />
					<span class="color">Mid</span> (payload bay) - Carries the major cargo of the mission.<br />
					<span class="color">Aft</span> (tail section) - Contains the shuttles main engines.</p>

				<!-- Forward Fuselage -->

				<div class="leftCol" style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">

					<!-- left col -->

					<div class="barH2"><h2>Forward Fuselage</h2>
					</div>
					<p class="pt">The forward fuselage contains the pressurized crew module with cockpit, living quarters and experiment operator's station. It also provides support for the nose section, the nose gear and the nose gear wheel well and doors.</p>
					<p>Crew members include pilot astronauts, called the commander and pilot who fly the shuttle, and mission specialist astronauts who are scientists and engineers trained to conduct the experiments on-board or perform specific tasks in orbit. Occasionally the crew also may include payload specialist astronauts in charge of the operations of a specific cargo.</p>
					<p>The cabin includes a circular side hatch, about a meter (3 feet) in diameter, that is used for entry and exit from the shuttle before launch and after landing.</p>
					<p>The crew station module is a three-section pressurized working, living and stowage compartment. It has two levels consisting of a Flight deck and a Mid deck / equipment bay.</p>

					<!-- Flight Deck -->

					<div class="barH3"><h3>Flight Deck</h3>
					</div>	
					<p>The Flight Deck has a commander's seat positioned on the left and a pilot's seat on the right and two seats behind. The vehicle may be piloted from either front seat and permits one-man emergency return. Each seat has manual flight controls, including rotation and translation hand controllers, rudder pedals and speed-brake controllers.</p>

					<p>The on-orbit displays and controls are at the aft end of the flight deck/crew compartment. The displays and controls on the left are for operating the orbiter, and those on the right are for operating and handling the payloads. There are more than 2,020 separate displays and controls located on the flight deck.</p>
					<p>Six pressure windshields, two overhead windows and two rear-viewing payload bay windows are located in the upper flight deck.</p>

					<!-- Mid Fuselage -->

					<div class="barH2"><h2>Mid Fuselage</h2>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">The main components of the Mid fuselage are the payload bay and the Remote Manipulator System (RMS).</p>
		
					<!-- Payload Bay -->

					<div class="barH3"><h3>Payload Bay</h3>
					</div>	
					<p>Payloads are the major cargo carried by the shuttle into orbit. They include satellites, Space Station components and experiments. Payloads may be attached directly to the orbiter or to carriers that are attached to the payload bay.
					<div class="center">

							</figcaption>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>Payloads for the International Space Station have included:<br />
					* All U.S. Segment assembly components,<br />
					* Spacehab Logistics Module - Pressurised cargo module.<br />
					* Integrated Cargo Carrier - Un-pressurised cargo pallet.<br />
					* MPLM (Multi-Purpose Logistics Module) - Contains supplies and equipment for the space station.</p>
					<p>Each payload bay door supports four radiator panels to provide cooling for shuttle components while in orbit. When the doors are opened, the four forward radiators are unlatched and tilted to the proper position. This allows heat radiation from both sides of these panels. The four aft radiator panels radiate from the upper side only.</p>

					<!-- Remote Manipulator System -->

					<div class="barH3"><h3>Remote Manipulator System</h3>
					</div>	
					<p>The Remote Manipulator System (RMS), also called the Shuttle Robot Arm or Canadarm, is a 15.2-meter (50-foot) long articulating arm remotely controlled from the flight deck of the orbiter. The elbow and wrist movements permit payloads to be grappled for deployment out of the payload bay or retrieved and secured for return to Earth.</p>

					<!-- Aft Fuselage -->

					<div class="barH2"><h2>Aft Fuselage</h2>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">The aft fuselage consists of:<br />
					* Space shuttle main engines (SSME),<br />
					* Orbital manoeuvring systems (left and right),<br />
					* Body flap,<br />
					* Vertical tail,<br />
					* Orbiter/external tank rear attachments.</p>

					</div>
					<p>The forward bulkhead of the aft fuselage closes it off from the mid fuselage. The upper portion of the bulkhead attaches to the vertical tail. The internal thrust structure supports the three space shuttle main engines, low pressure turbo-pumps and propellant lines.</p>

					<!-- Space Shuttle Main Engines -->

					<div class="barH3"><h3>Space Shuttle Main Engines</h3>
					</div>	
					<p>The three main engines of the space shuttle, in conjunction with the solid rocket boosters, provide the thrust to lift the orbiter off the ground for the initial ascent.</p>
					<div class="flexRow-se">

							</figcaption>
						</figure>
					</div>
					<p>The main engines continue to operate for 8.5 minutes after launch, the duration of the shuttle's powered flight.</p>
					<p>After the solid rockets are jettisoned, the main engines provide thrust which accelerates the shuttle from 4,828 kph to over 27,358 kph in just six minutes to reach orbit. They create a combined maximum thrust of more than 1.2 million ft-pounds.</p>
					<p>As the shuttle accelerates, the main engines burn a half million gallons of liquid propellant provided by the External Fuel Tank. This consists of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen at a mixture ratio of 6 to 1 by weight.</p>
					<p>The hydrogen and oxygen can reach a temperature of 3,315 degrees Celsius as they burn. This is higher than the boiling point of iron.</p>
					<p>The engines therefore operate at greater temperature extremes than any other piece of machinery ever built.</p>

			<!-- Mid deck  -->

			<div class="grid-2col" style="grid-template-columns: 1fr 1.5fr;">
				<div class="leftCol">
					<div class="barH3"><h3>Mid deck</h3>
					</div>	
					<p class="padt">The nominal maximum crew size is seven. The mid deck can be reconfigured by adding three rescue seats in place of the modular stowage and sleeping provisions. The seating capacity will then accommodate the rescue flight crew of three and a maximum rescued crew of seven.</p> 
					<p>The Mid deck / equipment bay contains provisions and stowage facilities for four crew sleep stations; stowage for the lithium hydroxide canisters and other gear; waste management system; personal hygiene station; work/dining table. A window is located in the crew entrance/exit hatch located in the Mid deck.</p>
		
					<!-- Mid deck / equipment bay -->
					
					<div class="barH3"><h3>Equipment Bay</h3>
					</div>	
					<p>A small lower "deck," called the equipment bay, is inaccessible unless the floor panels of the mid-deck are lifted up. This under-floor area houses avionics equipment, electronics equipment and a trash compartment.</p>

					<!-- Airlock -->

					<div class="barH3"><h3>Airlock</h3>
					</div>	
					<p>On missions that require the crew to perform space walks, known as extravehicular activity, or EVA an airlock is provided between the pressurized crew module and the payload bay (mid fuselage).</p>
					<p>The airlock can be located in one of several places:</p>
					<p class="line-height15">* Inside the orbiter crew module in the mid deck area mounted to the aft bulkhead,<br />
					* Outside the cabin also mounted to the bulkhead,<br />
					* On top of a tunnel adapter that can connect the pressurized Spacehab module with the orbiter cabin.<br />
					* Included in a docking module.</p>
					<p class="mb0">The airlock contains two spacesuits with expendables for two six-hour payload EVAs and one contingency or emergency EVA. It also contains mobility aids such as handrails to enable the crew to perform a variety of tasks. The airlock allows two crewmen room for changing spacesuits. An inner airlock hatch can be closed to seal the lock from the rest of the cabin. An outer hatch can be opened to exit into space. A docking mechanism to attach to the International Space Station may be located atop the airlock.<span id="specs"></span></p>

					<img class="middle" src="images/orbiter-ssme-flow.gif" alt="Orbiter SSME Flow">
					<p class="padt">The engines' exhaust is primarily water vapor as the hydrogen and oxygen combine. The thrust is developed in a staged combustion cycle. The propellants are partially combusted in dual pre-burners to produce high-pressure hot gas to drive the turbo-pumps. Combustion is completed in the main combustion chamber. Temperatures in the main engine combustion chamber can reach as high as 6,000 degrees Fahrenheit (3,315.6 degrees Celsius).</p>
					<p>Each main engine is 4.27 m (14 ft.) long and 2.29 m (7.5 ft.) wide at the mouth of the nozzle and produces a sea level thrust of 179,097 kg (375,000 pounds) and a vacuum thrust of 213,188 kg (470,000 pounds).</p>
					<p>They can be throttled over a thrust range of 65 percent to 109 percent. This provides for a high thrust level during lift off and the initial ascent phase but allows thrust to be reduced to limit acceleration to 3 g's during the final ascent phase.</p>
					<p>The engines are gimbaled to provide pitch, yaw and roll control during the ascent. They have a life of 7.5 hrs. and 55 starts.</p>
				
					<!-- Shuttle Testing -->
		
					<div class="barH2"><h2>Shuttle Testing</h2>
					</div>
					<p class="padt">The first four flights of the shuttle were used mainly to test the operation and systems for launch and <a class="elink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_spaceflight" target="_blank" title="External Link - Wikipedia">orbital flight</a>. A number of instrument packages were carried in the shuttle orbiters payload bay to assist with these tests. Some of these packages are summarized below. General science research was also performed during these flights.</p>  
					<p>From the fifth flight on the shuttle was said to be operational. Testing and crew training, however, continued.
