## Space Transport System
The U.S. Space Shuttle (or Space Transport System - STS) was the world's first reusable spacecraft, and the first spacecraft that could carry large payloads both to and from orbit. The shuttle launched like a rocket, maneuvered in Earth orbit like a spacecraft and landed like an airplane.
