				<p class="mt0">Spacelab is a re-usable, research laboratory facility carried in the payload bay of the shuttle. It consists of two major elements: a pressurized, habitable laboratory called a module and unpressurized platforms called pallets designed to support instruments which require direct exposure to space.</p>

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>Habitable Module</h2>

					<figcaption>
						Spacelab Habitable Module in Shuttle
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>The Spacelab Module comprises a cylindrical main laboratory flown in the rear of the Space Shuttle cargo bay, connected to the crew compartment by a tunnel. The module comes in two sections, a core segment and an experiment segment.</p>
				<p>The core segment can be flown by itself, in what is called the short module configuration, or coupled in tandem with the experiment segment in the long module configuration.</p>
				<p>Most of the time two segments were used in forming the Long Module configuration.</p>
				<p><span class="color">Module Core Segment</span> - houses data processing equipment and utilities for the module and pallets when both are flown together.</p>
				<p><span class="color">Module Experiment Segment</span> - provides further pressurized work area, space for additional experiment racks, and provision for mounting a scientific airlock to expose experiments carried in the module to the space environment.</p>
				<p class="mb0">The laboratory had an outer diameter of 4.12 meters (13.5 ft), and each segment a length of 2.7 meters (8.9 ft). Two habitable modules were built, named LM1 and LM2.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="main-pane pt0">
				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>Spacelab Pallets</h2>
				</div>
				<p>The Spacelab Pallet is a U-shaped platform for mounting instrumentation, large instruments, experiments requiring exposure to space, and instruments requiring a large field of view, such as telescopes. It has several hard points for mounting heavy equipment.</p>
				<p>It can be used in single configuration or stacked end to end in double or triple configurations. Up to five pallets can be configured in the Space Shuttle payload bay by using a double pallet plus a triple pallet.</p>
				<p>When pallets are flown without the module, the subsystems necessary for experiment operation are contained in a pressurized cylinder called an "igloo".</p>

				<div class="header-bar2"><h2>Igloo and Instrument Pointing System (IPS)</h2>
				</div>
				<figure class="fl mt mr">
					<img class="shadow-gold" src="images/facilities-spacelab-igloo-ips-drawing.jpg" alt="Spacelab Igloo and IPS">
					<figcaption>
						Igloo and IPS in Shuttle Payload Bay
					</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>On space flights where pallets were flown without a habitable module, a pressurized cylinder known as the igloo was included.</p>
				<p>The igloo was used to house and protect the subsystems needed to operate the Spacelab pallet equipment.</p>
				<p>It was 10 feet tall, had a diameter of 5 feet, and weighed 2,500 lb.</p>
				<p>Two igloo units were manufactured, both by Belgium company SABCA, and both were used on space flights in the shuttle.</p>
				<p class="mb0">The Instrument Pointing System (IPS) was a gimbaled pointing device, capable of aiming telescopes, cameras, or other instruments. It was manufactured by Dornier.</p>

				<p>U.S. commercial company SPACEHAB Inc. has been called Astrotech Corporation since 2009. It provided space habitat microgravity experimentation equipment and services to NASA during the Space Shuttle era.</p>
				<p>Initially used for microgravity research, it was then used for supporting the docking program between the shuttle and the Russian space station, Mir.</p>
				<p>Finally it was used as a key facility to support the building and operation of the International Space Station (ISS).</p>

				<p>The Pressurized module is habitable and located in the forward end of the shuttle orbiter cargo bay. It is accessed from the orbiter mid deck through a tunnel adapter connected to the airlock. An additional airlock is attached to this tunnel so that space walks (EVA's) can be performed while the shuttle is docked to the ISS.</p>
				<p>Two SPACEHAB modules can be joined together to form a "Double Module" which were used on most of the Mir and ISS missions. Equipment can also be carried externally on the roof of the Spacehab double module and accessed during Space-walks (EVA's).</p>
				<p>A SPACEHAB Research Double Module (RDM) flew only on the ill-fated Columbia STS-107 mission, in which it was destroyed.</p>

				<p class="mt0">The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) is a pressurised cargo module built for NASA by the Italian Space Agency, Agenzia Spaziale Italiana (ASI), at the Alenia Aerospazio factory in Turin, Italy. This is main Italian contribution to the International Space Station. Italy is one of the partner nations in the ISS project.</p>

							MPLM Raffaello berthed to the ISS
						</figcaption>
					</figure>
				<p>The MPLM carries equipment, supplies, laboratory racks and experiments for the station and is transported to the ISS in the shuttle's payload bay. There is no internal access from the shuttle to the module.</p>
				<p>After the shuttle is docked to the Station the MPLM is lifted from the cargo bay using the shuttle's or the station's robot arm. It is then connected to a station berthing port using the Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM), which locks it in place with an airtight seal.</p>
				<p>The MPLM is then be unloaded directly into the station and re-loaded with waste and items to be returned to Earth. At the end of the mission the MPLM is undocked from the station and re-berthed in the shuttle's payload bay for return to Earth. The MPLM is then re-conditioned for its next mission.</p>
				<p>Three Multi-Purpose Logistics Modules have been built to allow time for turn around and back-up. The modules have been named after famous Italians of the past:</p>
				<p class="line-height15"><span class="color">Leonardo:</span> Named after Leonardo da Vinci, an extraordinary Italian inventor-scientist, civil engineer, architect and artist.<br />
				<span class="color">Raffaello:</span> Named after Raffaello Sanzio, an artist renowned for his visual achievement of human grandeur.<br />
